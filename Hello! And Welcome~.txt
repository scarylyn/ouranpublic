Hello and welcome! (Yes I'm gonna say it every time)

I'm Kari, otherwise known as Scarylyn, and I just wanted to thank you for taking the time out of your life to help with our humble project!


I also wanted to take a moment to explain to you what you'll see here in these files.

In one folder you'll find all the files I was able to extract from my personal copy of Ouran. In the other folder you'll find the .json files that I've extracted from the .bin files, but keep in mind that there are unextracted bin files in the "movie" and "scene" folders.

(Side note: In order to read Japanese in the the json files, I've been using EditPadPro 8 and converting the font to Shift-JIS.)


I've also included the tool that I used to extract them, if you're curious about it.

I credit github user "jaga8285" (as well as their special thanks to JJJewel and azerty1) for the creation of the tool, and you can find their notes on it here: https://github.com/jaga8285/OuranExtractionTool/blob/main/README.md


They will all also be credited in the credits of the game itself when it's completed! It's thanks to them that this is all possible!
