Hello and welcome! (Yes I'm gonna say it every time)

I'm Kari, otherwise known as Scarylyn, and I just wanted to thank you for taking the time out of your life to help with our humble project!


I also wanted to take a moment to explain to you what you'll see here in these files.

In the folder you'll find all the files I was able to extract from my personal copy of Ouran. I've also included the tool that I used to extract them, if you're curious about it.

I credit github user "jaga8285" (as well as their special thanks to JJJewel and azerty1) for the creation of the tool, and you can find their notes on it here: https://github.com/jaga8285/OuranExtractionTool/blob/main/README.md


They will all also be credited in the credits of the game itself when it's completed! It's thanks to them that this is all possible!
